The aim of a quantitative trading researcher is to seek out alpha (new streams of uncorrelated risk-adjusted returns) and then exploit these returns via a systematic trading model and execution infrastructure.

Alpha is difficult to find, as by definition once it is well-known it decays and seeks to be an uncorrelated source of returns. Instead it gradually becomes a risk factor and thus loses its risk-adjusted profitability.

This project concentrates on three major areas of mathematical modelling– Bayesian Statistics, Time Series Analysis and Machine Learning– that will augment your quantitative trading research process in order to help you discover sources of alpha.

Many of these techniques are in use at some of the largest global asset managers and quantitative hedge funds. I describe these techniques and how they can be applied to financial data in order to develop testable systematic trading strategies.

Over the years there has been a significant increase in the availability of software for carrying out statistical analysis at large scales–the so called "big data" era. 

Most of this software is completely free, open source, extremely well-tested and straightforward to use. The prevalence of free software coupled to the availability of financial data provided has lead to a sharp increase in individuals deciding to become quant traders. Unfortunately, many of these individuals never get past learning basic "technical analysis".
They avoid important topics such as risk management, portfolio construction and algorithmic execution–topics given significant attention in institutional environments. In addition "retail" traders often neglect more effective means of generating alpha, such as can be provided via detailed statistical analysis.

 The aim of this project is to provide the "next step" for those who have already begun their quantitative trading career, or are looking to try more advanced methods. While I will cover techniques that are currently in deployment at some of the large quantitative hedge funds and asset management firms, my marea of focus here will be confined to rigourous 
 statistical analysis. This may sound like a dry topic, but rest assured that not only is it extremely interesting when applied to real world data, but it also provides a solid "mental framework" for how to think about future trading methods and approaches.
 
 Statistical analysis is a huge field of academic interest and only a fraction of the field can be considered within this project. Trying to distill the topics important for quantitative trading is difficult. Hence, I will only cover:

 • Bayesian Statistics
 • Time Series Analysis
 • Machine Learning
 
 Each of these three areas is extremely useful for quantitative trading research.
